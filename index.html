            <h2 id="meet">Hi! I'm Kaite Kull</h2>
            <p>I am your newest software developer. My home base is Longmont, Colorado, but for the past six months I have been living in Airbnbs across the country with my fiancée and our two dogs. </p>
            <p>As a Team Manager and people leader I have been helping my teams find their passions and next steps in their careers, but in 2021 it was time to find mine. I found a program at work that could change my career path from customer service to software development, but I didn't have any background knowledge at the time. I knew right away it was something I could fall in love with so I began my self study before enrolling in Thinkful a few months later.</p>
            <p class="list">Software development excites me because:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>I love creative problem solving</li>
                <li>I have the opportunity to create on my own and as part of a team</li>
                <li>I get to create beautiful things</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="about">About Me</h3>
            <p>I have my bachelors degree in English Literature and Business in the Liberal Arts from St. Lawrence University and I am an avid reader. After graduating college I moved to Denver, Colorado to work for Zillow where I have grown into a Team Manager and stepped into the Co-Chair position of our Pride Network (LGBTQ+ Employee Resource Group).</p>
            <p>I love to travel and my fiancée and I have been driving across the country since June of 2021, exploring new places with our two dogs. Our goal at the end of our great adventure is to find a place to call home (that isn't her 2007 Chevy Silverado).</p>
            <p>As a student at Thinkful I have committed to investing in myself and my future and I could not be more excited about it or more grateful for my support system who encourage me to get better every day. As a former student athlete I have the drive and resilience to become great at anything I set my mind to. And lucky for you I am going to be your next great software engineer.</p>
            <p>If you're looking to hire a creative, driven, team oriented developer to your team please reach out! I am so excited to build great software with amazing developers.</p>
